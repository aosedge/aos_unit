Description: AosEdge Unit - VM management for edge computing
 AosEdge Unit provides automated VM management for edge computing
 deployments. It manages QEMU/KVM virtual machines with network
 bridging, DHCP, and port forwarding.
 .
 This package supports both x86_64 and aarch64 guest architectures
 via TCG emulation, allowing cross-architecture VM deployment
 regardless of host hardware.
 .
 Features:
  * Automated network bridge setup
  * DHCP server configuration for VMs
  * Port forwarding for SSH access
  * Support for x86_64 and aarch64 guest architectures (TCG mode)
  * Systemd integration for service management
  * Zero external dependencies (pure bash/AWK implementation)
